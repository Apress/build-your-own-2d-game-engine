		Stencil Tutorial</h1>
		
		
		<hr>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this tutorial, we will look at how to use a stencil with renderables.</p>
        
		
	<hr>
		<h2><a id="resolution"></a>Stencil</h2>
		<p>There are two functions that need to be used in order to stencil: startStenciling and stopStenciling.</p>
		<p>To start stenciling, we need a renderable that will be used as a stencil and the camera we are drawing to.
		The stencil can be a regular, texture or sprite renderable.
		Any draw call to the same camera between startStenciling and stopStenciling will be stenciled.
		The stencil uses the alpha channel of the given renderable. Any white area in a sprite's alpha channel will be drawn while any black area will not be drawn.</p>
        

		<figure>
		<pre>MyGameScene.prototype.draw = function () {
	// Clear the screen
	gEngine.Core.clearCanvas([0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0]);
	
	this.mCamera.setupViewProjection();
    
	<strong>
	gEngine.Stencil.startStenciling(this.mStencil, this.mCamera);
	this.mBg.draw(this.mCamera);
	gEngine.Stencil.stopStenciling();
};</pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Stenciling allows for having renderables only show within a given area designated by the stencil renderable's alpha channel.
		The area that is drawn to remains separate from other objects allowing for it to be independently manipulated.
		This is used in multiple UI elements such as the Button and Bar.</p>
